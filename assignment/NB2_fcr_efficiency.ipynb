    "Our power system is extremely complex. How are thousands of power plants able to provide electricity to millions of consumers, specially since production and demand have to exactly match intermittently?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_{generation}(t) = P_{consumption}(t), \\quad \\forall~t \\in T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The system operators take great care in the planing-phase to deal with this issue. Based on the forecasting of the power demand and generation from renewable sources, the dispatch of power plants is scheduled.\n",
    "Nonetheless, there remains a mismatch caused by forecast errors or unforseable events, such as the unexpected shut-down of a big power plant. In that case special generators are assigned with power capacity reserved to compensate this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "These *preuqualified* generators balance the system by reacting to the system-frequency. This an equivalent measure, since power inbalance causes a deviation from the nominal frequency. [The basic logic behind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_equation) is: if more power is drawn than the generators currently produce, the deficit will be covered form the inertia of the synchronous generators, slowing the rotors down. The other way around applies equally: if more power injected than the demand requires, the generator rotors will start to accelerate. By correcting the frequency and mantaning it close to the nominal frequency the stability of the grid is assured. Big frequency deviation could cause system cut-offs and blackouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency control is dealt with mechanisms that are enforced in different stages. \n",
    "The [Frequency Containtment Reserve (FCR)](https://www.next-kraftwerke.com/knowledge/frequency-containment-reserve-fcr) is the primary reserve and reacts to disturbances instantly, acting as a safety net of the power system.\n",
    "If the deviation persists for a few minutes, the Frequency Restoration Reserve (FRR) steps in to alleviate the FCR. The FFR itself is comprised from the secondary reserve followed by the tertiary reserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Battery energy storage systems provide flexible control and fast reaction times, so they are very well suited for providing FCR services. FCR is the most relevant application for large grid-scale BESS, they have now been widely adopted and account over x MW of BESS providing the service in Germany.\n",
